## The project

Cubetopia is a narrative Free software video
game and interactive art experience where the player is
asked to build their own perfect future, one narrative
decision at a time.

With each step come societal, environmental and political
choices and impacts. There are no right or wrong answers,
they each present their own challenges, which provides the
game with replayability.

As the choices are made, the visual art and music become
more complex and reflect the player’s choices. Epic audio samples referencing the CCC's history of changing the world are woven into the dreamlike narrative.

“Try to look at what the world was like a few hundred years ago,
and try to imagine what you want the world to look like in a
hundred years. What do you want it to look like? What do you
think is right for people in a hundred years? How do you hope
people that you will never meet will live?”

### Navigating through choices

## The cube

The choices presented to players implicitly draw on utopian
philosophies, both those with centuries of thought behind
them and younger movements, and, explicitly, their presence
in the CCC community.

The basic bones of the game are arranged on a
three-dimensional decision cube, where the emphasis goes
from central planning to commerce, small communities to
global cooperation, and from nature to high-tech and
space-faring. These are the primary metrics.


The challenge of the game is to guarantee freedom, equity
and accountability in each type of society.



## Narrative beats

The underlying mechanic of the game prompts the player to
choose between the different types of utopian societies,
with a follow-up narrative exploring the unique challenges of
each, and the player’s choices here adjusting the overall
position on the cube.

Some of these decisions may influence secondary metrics - personal autonomy, state or
sustainability. These are tracked in the background and influence the
outcome.

“The hacker mindset is a post-apocalyptically appropriate
way of thinking. Wouldn’t you run to your hackerspace, if
things really went wrong? If the world went down in chaos,
I would really want it to happen somewhere at the end of
December, because you all would be the people I would
want to be around.”
